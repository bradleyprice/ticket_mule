== Database support

TicketMule runs on PostgreSQL by default.  MySQL and SQLite can be used with a small change to a couple of queries in the Ticket model.  See {issue #10}[https://github.com/appogee/ticket_mule/issues/#issue/10] for details.

== Install

Basic installation creates a fresh database with a single admin user.  See +db+/+seeds+.+rb+ for admin user information.

After performing the basic setup, you can choose to test drive TicketMule by running the +faker+ rake task as described below.

Install gems:

  $ gem install bundler
  $ bundle install

Create a database.yml file and modify as needed:

  $ cp config/database.postgresql.yml config/database.yml

Configure TicketMule settings in the <em>production</em> block of +config+/+config+.+yml+.  See comments for details.

Modify +config+/+environment+.+rb+ settings such as default timezone, rails gem version, relative url root (if applicable), etc.

Modify +db+/+seeds+.+rb+ to create the seed data for your installation of TicketMule.  This is where you create your organization's groups, statuses, and priorities.

Choose between basic installation or installation with test data:

<b>Basic installation</b> create database and schema, and initialize with seed data:

  $ rake db:setup

<b>Test drive</b> create database and schema, initialize with seed data, and load 150 contacts, 500 tickets, and 4 non-admin users (see +lib+/+tasks+/+faker+.+rake+ for details):

  $ rake faker

== Notes

By default, users can create their own accounts by navigating to /users/new.  If this is not desired and you only want admins to create user accounts, a small change to +config+/+routes+.+rb+ is required.  The users resource will need the exception added for the <em>new</em> action.  See the comments for the users resource map for details.

When you add an alert to a ticket, you will only receive an email alert when the ticket's attributes change.  You will not receive an email alert when a comment or attachment is added.
